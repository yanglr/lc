However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the live preview server and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you should see them almost instantly after saving. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir key: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory. The directory layout of the theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics.html # - Google Analytics \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 disqus.html # - Disqus \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-date.html # Last updated date \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-link.html # Link to source file \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html , create a footer.html file in the overrides/partials directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks recommended \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a block, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Purpose analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the Disqus integration extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) outdated Wraps the version warning scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation . Additional variables \u00b6 Besides template blocks, Material for MkDocs provides extra variables for parts that cannot be overridden with template blocks (due to technical limitations of the template engine). If you want to add further information after the Made with Material for MkDocs hint in the footer, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% set extracopyright %} <!-- Add your additional information here --> {% endset %} Material for MkDocs provides the following additional variables: Block name Purpose extracopyright Adds custom copyright information Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is built on top of TypeScript , RxJS and SASS , and uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together. 1 If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 14 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the watcher with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs live preview server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overwritten when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in the original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original theme. Prior to version 7.0, the build was based on Webpack. This led to broken builds due to frequent incompatibilities with loaders and plugins, so we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner custom solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself. This enabled us to remove more than 500 dependencies (~30% less). \u21a9","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful.

First, ensure that you have a Python version of 3 or higher installed: python --version If you're good to go, create and activate a virtual environment with: python -m venv venv source ./venv/bin/activate Note that the second venv is the name of the folder where to create the virtual environment \u2013 you may choose it as you like. Your terminal should now print (venv) before the prompt and the python executable should be located inside the folder you just created. Next, install Material for MkDocs with pip , which will download and install all packages in the venv folder you just created, including MkDocs and its dependencies: pip install mkdocs-material Verify that MkDocs and Material for MkDocs were both installed correctly: mkdocs --version mkdocs serve --help MkDocs should list material as an option under the --theme flag. When you're finished working with MkDocs, you can exit the virtual environment with: deactivate User space Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. While this is not a global installation, it's still not isolated and may lead to problems when you use different versions of Material for MkDocs in other projects: pip install --user mkdocs-material Upgrade Python Upgrade your Python installation by installing Python with Homebrew . This should eliminate a lot of problems you will run into with pip . Yet, it's still not an isolated installation which may also lead to the same problems as installing in user space: brew upgrade python","title":"Inadequate permissions"},{"location":"upgrading/","text":"Upgrading \u00b6 Upgrade to the latest version with: pip install --upgrade mkdocs-material Inspect the currently installed version with: pip show mkdocs-material Upgrading from 6.x to 7.x \u00b6 What's new? \u00b6 Added support for deploying multiple versions Added support for integrating a language selector Added support for rendering admonitions as inline blocks Rewrite of the underlying reactive architecture Removed Webpack in favor of reactive build strategy (-480 dependencies) Fixed keyboard navigation for code blocks after content tabs switch Changes to mkdocs.yml \u00b6 extra.version.method \u00b6 The versioning method configuration was renamed to extra.version.provider to allow for different versioning strategies in the future: 7.x extra : version : provider : mike 6.x extra : version : method : mike Changes to *.html files \u00b6 The templates have undergone a set of changes to make them future-proof.

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material for MkDocs with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px .

It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and integration from the ground up.

Martin Donath \u00b7 @squidfunk September 26, 2021 \u00b7 5 min read \u00b7 7.3.0+insiders-3.1.1 Two weeks ago, Material for MkDocs Insiders shipped a brand new search plugin , yielding massive improvements in usability , but also in speed and size of the search index. Interestingly, as discussed in the previous blog article, we only scratched the surface of what's now possible. This release brings some useful features that enhance the writing experience, allowing for more fine-grained control of what pages, sections and blocks of a Markdown file should be indexed by the built-in search functionality. The following section discusses existing solutions for excluding pages and sections from the search index. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Prior art \u00b6 MkDocs has a rich and thriving ecosystem of plugins , and it comes as no surprise that there's already a fantastic plugin by @chrieke to exclude specific sections of a Markdown file \u2013 the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin. It can be installed with: pip install mkdocs-exclude-search How it works : the plugin post-processes the search_index.json file that is generated by the built-in search plugin, giving the author the ability to exclude certain pages and sections by adding a few lines of configuration to mkdocs.yml . An example: plugins : - search - exclude-search : exclude : - page.md - page.md#section - directory/* - /*/page.md It's easy to see that the plugin follows a configuration-centric approach, which adds support for advanced filtering techniques like infix- and suffix-filtering using wildcards. While this is a very powerful idea, it comes with some downsides: Exclusion patterns and content are not co-located : exclusion patterns need to be defined in mkdocs.yml , and not as part of the respective document or section to be excluded. This might result in stale exclusion patterns, leading to unintended behavior: When a headline is changed, its slug (permalink) also changes, which might suddenly match (or unmatch) a pattern, e.g., when an author fixes a typo in a headline. As exclusion patterns support the use of wildcards, different authors might overwrite each other's patterns without any immediate feedback since the plugin does only report the number of excluded documents \u2013 not what has been excluded. 1 Exclusion control might be too coarse : The mkdocs-exclude-search plugin only allows for the exclusion of pages and sections. It's not possible to exclude parts of a section, e.g., content that is irrelevant to search but must be included as part of the documentation. What's new? \u00b6 The latest Insiders release brings fine-grained control for excluding pages, sections, and blocks from the search index, implemented through front matter, as well as the Attribute List extension. Note that it doesn't replace the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin but complements it. Excluding pages \u00b6 An entire page can be excluded from the search index by adding a simple directive to the front matter of the respective Markdown file. The good thing is that the author now only has to check the top of the document to learn whether it is excluded or not: --- search: exclude: true --- # Document title ... Excluding sections \u00b6 If a section should be excluded, the author can use the Attribute List extension to add a pragma called { data-search-exclude } at the end of a heading. The pragma is not included in the final HTML, as search pragmas are filtered by the search plugin before the page is rendered: docs/page.md # Document title ## Section 1 The content of this section is included ## Section 2 { data-search-exclude } The content of this section is excluded search_index.json { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#section-1\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this section is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Section 1\" } ] } Excluding blocks \u00b6 If even more fine-grained control is desired, the pragma can be added to any block-level element or inline-level element that is officially supported by the Attribute List extension: docs/page.md # Document title The content of this block is included The content of this block is excluded { data-search-exclude } search_index.json { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this block is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, ] } Conclusion \u00b6 The latest release brings three simple ways to control more precisely what goes into the search index and what doesn't. It complements the already very powerful mkdocs-exclude-search plugin, allowing for new methods of shaping the structure, size and content of the search index. When the log level is set to DEBUG , the plugin will report exactly which pages and sections have been excluded from the search index, but MkDocs will now flood the terminal with debug output from its core and other plugins. \u21a9","title":"Excluding content from search"},{"location":"blog/2021/excluding-content-from-search/#excluding-content-from-search","text":"The latest Insiders release brings three new simple ways to exclude dedicated parts of a document from the search index, allowing for more fine-grained control.

However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and what's about to come. The next section discusses the architecture and issues of the current search implementation. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Architecture \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses lunr together with lunr-languages to implement its client-side search capabilities. When a documentation page is loaded and JavaScript is available, the search index as generated by the built-in search plugin during the build process is requested from the server: const index$ = document . forms . namedItem ( \"search\" ) ? __search ? . index || requestJSON < SearchIndex > ( new URL ( \"search/search_index.json\" , config . base ) ) : NEVER Search index \u00b6 The search index includes a stripped-down version of all pages. Let's take a look at an example to understand precisely what the search index contains from the original Markdown file: Expand to inspect example docs/page.md # Example ## Text It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even add [ links ]( # ), or even `code` : ``` if (isAwesome) { return true } ``` ## Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: 1. One 2. Two 3. Three Sometimes you want bullet points: * Start a line with a star * Profit! search_index.json { \"config\" : { \"indexing\" : \"full\" , \"lang\" : [ \"en\" ], \"min_search_length\" : 3 , \"prebuild_index\" : false , \"separator\" : \"[\\\\s\\\\-]+\" }, \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index, we immediately see several problems: All content is included twice : the search index contains one entry with the entire contents of the page, and one entry for each section of the page, i.e., each block preceded by a headline or subheadline. This significantly contributes to the size of the search index. All structure is lost : when the search index is built, all structural information like HTML tags and attributes are stripped from the content. While this approach works well for paragraphs and inline formatting, it might be problematic for lists and code blocks. An excerpt: \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } Lists Sometimes you want \u2026 Context : for an untrained eye, the result can look like gibberish, as it's not immediately apparent what classifies as text and what as code. Furthermore, it's not clear that Lists is a headline as it's merged with the code block before and the paragraph after it. Punctuation : inline elements like links that are immediately followed by punctuation are separated by whitespace (see , and : in the excerpt). This is because all extracted text is joined with a whitespace character during the construction of the search index. It's not difficult to see that it can be quite challenging to implement a good search experience for theme authors, which is why Material for MkDocs (up to now) did some monkey patching to be able to render slightly more meaningful search previews. Search worker \u00b6 The actual search functionality is implemented as part of a web worker 1 , which creates and manages the lunr search index. When search is initialized, the following steps are taken: Linking sections with pages : The search index is parsed, and each section is linked to its parent page. The parent page itself is not indexed , as it would lead to duplicate results, so only the sections remain. Linking is necessary, as search results are grouped by page. Tokenization : The title and text values of each section are split into tokens by using the separator as configured in mkdocs.yml . Tokenization itself is carried out by lunr's default tokenizer , which doesn't allow for lookahead or separators spanning multiple characters. Why is this important and a big deal? We will see later how much more we can achieve with a tokenizer that is capable of separating strings with lookahead. Indexing : As a final step, each section is indexed. When querying the index, if a search query includes one of the tokens as returned by step 2., the section is considered to be part of the search result and passed to the main thread. Now, that's basically how the search worker operates. Sure, there's a little more magic involved, e.g., search results are post-processed and rescored to account for some shortcomings of lunr , but in general, this is how data gets into and out of the index. Search previews \u00b6 Users should be able to quickly scan and evaluate the relevance of a search result in the given context, which is why a concise summary with highlighted occurrences of the search terms found is an essential part of a great search experience. This is where the current search preview generation falls short, as some of the search previews appear not to include any occurrence of any of the search terms. This was due to the fact that search previews were truncated after a maximum of 320 characters , as can be seen here: The first two results look like they're not relevant, as they don't seem to include the query string the user just searched for. Yet, they are. A better solution to this problem has been on the roadmap for a very, very long time, but in order to solve this once and for all, several factors need to be carefully considered: Word boundaries : some themes 2 for static site generators generate search previews by expanding the text left and right next to an occurrence, stopping at a whitespace character when enough words have been consumed. A preview might look like this: \u2026 channels, e.g., or which can be configured via mkdocs.yml \u2026 While this may work for languages that use whitespace as a separator between words, it breaks down for languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 , as they have non-whitespace word boundaries and use dedicated segmenters to split strings into tokens. Context-awareness : Although whitespace doesn't work for all languages, one could argue that it could be a good enough solution. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true for code blocks, as the removal of whitespace might change meaning in some languages. Structure : Preserving structural information is not a must, but apparently beneficial to build more meaningful search previews which allow for a quick evaluation of relevance. If a word occurrence is part of a code block, it should be rendered as a code block. What's new? \u00b6 After we built a solid understanding of the problem space and before we dive into the internals of our new search implementation to see which of the problems it already solves, a quick overview of what features and improvements it brings: Better : support for rich search previews , preserving the structural information of code blocks, inline code, and lists, so they are rendered as-is, as well as lookahead tokenization , more accurate highlighting , and improved stability of typeahead. Also, a slightly better UX . Faster and smaller : significant decrease in search index size of up to 48% due to improved extraction and construction techniques, resulting in a search experience that is up to 95% faster, which is particularly helpful for large documentation projects. Note that our new search implementation is currently 'Insiders only', which means that it is reserved for sponsors because it's those sponsors that make features like this possible. I want to become a sponsor Rich search previews \u00b6 As we rebuilt the search plugin from scratch, we reworked the construction of the search index to preserve the structural information of code blocks, inline code, as well as unordered and ordered lists. Using the example from the search index section, here's how it looks: Now Before Now, code blocks are first-class citizens of search previews , and even inline code formatting is preserved. Let's take a look at the new structure of the search index to understand why: Expand to inspect search index Now { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"<p>It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links, or even <code>code</code>:</p> <pre><code>if (isAwesome){\\n return true\\n}\\n</code></pre>\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"<p>Sometimes you want numbered lists:</p> <ol> <li>One</li> <li>Two</li> <li>Three</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes you want bullet points:</p> <ul> <li>Start a line with a star</li> <li>Profit!</li> </ul>\" } ] } Before { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index again, we can see how the situation improved: Content is included only once : the search index does not include the content of the page twice, as only the sections of a page are part of the search index. This leads to a significant reduction in size, fewer bytes to transfer, and a smaller search index. Some structure is preserved : each section of the search index includes a small subset of HTML to provide the necessary structure to allow for more sophisticated search previews. Revisiting our example from before, let's look at an excerpt: Now \u2026 links, or even < code > code </ code > : </ p > < pre >< code > if (isAwesome){ \u2026 }\\n </ code ></ pre > Before \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } The punctuation issue is gone, as no additional whitespace is inserted, and the preserved markup yields additional context to make scanning search results more effective. On to the next step in the process: tokenization . Tokenizer lookahead \u00b6 The default tokenizer of lunr uses a regular expression to split a given string by matching each character against the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml . This doesn't allow for more complex separators based on lookahead or multiple characters. Fortunately, our new search implementation provides an advanced tokenizer that doesn't have these shortcomings and supports more complex regular expressions. As a result, Material for MkDocs just changed its own separator configuration to the following value: [\\s\\-,:!=\\[\\]()\"/]+|(?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\\.(?!\\d)|&[lg]t; While the first part up to the first | contains a list of single control characters at which the string should be split, the following three sections explain the remainder of the regular expression. 4 Case changes \u00b6 Many programming languages use PascalCase or camelCase naming conventions. When a user searches for the term case , it's quite natural to expect for PascalCase and camelCase to show up. By adding the following match group to the separator, this can now be achieved with ease: (?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z]) This regular expression is a combination of a negative lookahead ( \\b , i.e., not a word boundary) and a positive lookahead ( [A-Z][a-z] , i.e., an uppercase character followed by a lowercase character), and has the following behavior: PascalCase Pascal , Case camelCase camel , Case UPPERCASE UPPERCASE Searching for searchHighlight now brings up the section discussing the search.highlight feature flag, which also demonstrates that this even works for search queries now! 5 Version numbers \u00b6 Indexing version numbers is another problem that can be solved with a small lookahead. Usually, . should be considered a separator to split words like search.highlight . However, splitting version numbers at . will make them undiscoverable. Thus, the following expression: \\.(?!\\d) This regular expression matches a . only if not immediately followed by a digit \\d , which leaves version numbers discoverable. Searching for 7.2.6 brings up the 7.2.6 release notes. HTML/XML tags \u00b6 If your documentation includes HTML/XML code examples, you may want to allow users to find specific tag names. Unfortunately, the < and > control characters are encoded in code blocks as &lt; and &gt; . Now, adding the following expression to the separator allows for just that: &[lg]t; Searching for custom search worker script brings up the section on custom search and matches the script tag among the other search terms discovered. We've only just begun to scratch the surface of the new possibilities tokenizer lookahead brings. If you found other useful expressions, you're invited to share them in the comment section. Accurate highlighting \u00b6 Highlighting is the last step in the process of search and involves the highlighting of all search term occurrences in a given search result. For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists. Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview. If a term only occurs in a code block, it's the code block that gets rendered, see, for example, the results of twitter . Benchmarks \u00b6 We conducted two benchmarks \u2013 one with the documentation of Material for MkDocs itself, and one with a very massive corpus of Markdown files with more than 800,000 words \u2013 a size most documentation projects will likely never reach: Before Now Relative Material for MkDocs Index size 573 kB 335 kB \u201342% Index size ( gzip ) 105 kB 78 kB \u201327% Indexing time 7 265 ms 177 ms \u201334% KJV Markdown 8 Index size 8.2 MB 4.4 MB \u201347% Index size ( gzip ) 2.3 MB 1.2 MB \u201348% Indexing time 2,700 ms 1,390 ms \u201348% Benchmark results The results show that indexing time, which is the time that it takes to set up the search when the page is loaded, has dropped by up to 48%, which means the new search is up to 95% faster . This is a significant improvement, particularly relevant for large documentation projects. While 1,3s still may sound like a long time, using the new client-side search together with instant loading only creates the search index on the initial page load. When navigating, the search index is preserved across pages, so the cost does only have to be paid once. User interface \u00b6 Additionally, some small improvements have been made, most prominently the more results on this page button, which now sticks to the top of the search result list when open. This enables the user to jump out of the list more quickly. What's next? \u00b6 Our new search implementation is a big improvement to Material for MkDocs. It solves some long-standing issues which needed to be tackled for years. Yet, it's only the start of a search experience that is going to get better and better. Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. Prior to version 5.0 , search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in version 5.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9","title":"Search: better, faster, smaller"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#search-better-faster-smaller","text":"This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search, delivering a significantly better user experience while making it faster and smaller at the same time.

For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists. Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview. If a term only occurs in a code block, it's the code block that gets rendered, see, for example, the results of twitter .","title":"Accurate highlighting"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#benchmarks","text":"We conducted two benchmarks \u2013 one with the documentation of Material for MkDocs itself, and one with a very massive corpus of Markdown files with more than 800,000 words \u2013 a size most documentation projects will likely never reach: Before Now Relative Material for MkDocs Index size 573 kB 335 kB \u201342% Index size ( gzip ) 105 kB 78 kB \u201327% Indexing time 7 265 ms 177 ms \u201334% KJV Markdown 8 Index size 8.2 MB 4.4 MB \u201347% Index size ( gzip ) 2.3 MB 1.2 MB \u201348% Indexing time 2,700 ms 1,390 ms \u201348% Benchmark results The results show that indexing time, which is the time that it takes to set up the search when the page is loaded, has dropped by up to 48%, which means the new search is up to 95% faster . This is a significant improvement, particularly relevant for large documentation projects. While 1,3s still may sound like a long time, using the new client-side search together with instant loading only creates the search index on the initial page load.

It solves some long-standing issues which needed to be tackled for years. Yet, it's only the start of a search experience that is going to get better and better. Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. Prior to version 5.0 , search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in version 5.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9","title":"What's next?"},{"location":"insiders/","text":"Insiders \u00b6 Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Payment \u00b6 We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at sponsors@squidfunk.com . Note that one-time payments are not eligible for Insiders, but of course, very appreciated. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 Note that $10/month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. If you sponsor with a lower amount, it's still very much appreciated, but you won't be granted access to Insiders. Custom amounts of $10+ are also eligible. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 Admonition \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Admonition extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, is integrated with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Details \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Details extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , adds the ability to make admonitions collapsible . It can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.details SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code and content blocks inside admonitions , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Usage \u00b6 Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block must start with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier. Example : !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks . Example : !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content \u00b6 Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks. While the parser from the standard Markdown library doesn't account for nested blocks, the SuperFences extension adds the ability to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. ``` python def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 The Details extension adds support for rendering collapsible admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks, but must start with ??? . Example : ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after ??? will render the block as open on page load: Example : ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental Admonitions and Details can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. sidebars), placing them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier. Important : Admonitions that use the inline modifiers must be declared prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. inline end Example / Result : Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Material for MkDocs provides different ways to set up syntax highlighting for code blocks, either during build time using Pygments or during runtime using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Configuration \u00b6 Highlight \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension \u00b7 Supersedes: CodeHilite The Highlight extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , integrates with Material for MkDocs and provides several options for configuring syntax highlighting of code blocks: use_pygments Default: true \u2013 This option allows to control whether highlighting should be carried out during build time by Pygments or runtime with a JavaScript highlighter. Remember to add the necessary additional stylesheets and JavaScript if you want to use the latter: Pygments markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.superfences JavaScript markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : false Syntax highlighting with Highlight.js Highlight.js can be integrated by creating an additional JavaScript file initializing the highlighter and including the respective stylesheet and JavaScript from a CDN serving Highlight.js in mkdocs.yml : docs/javascripts/config.js document $ . subscribe (() => { hljs . highlightAll () }) mkdocs.yml extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js - javascripts/config.js extra_css : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css Note that Highlight.js has no affiliation with the Highlight extension. linenums Default: false \u2013 This option will add line numbers to all code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers later in this document, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, all of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a table, inline and pymdownx-inline render line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx-inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of table or pymdownx-inline is recommended. Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but might yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. InlineHilite \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions also integrates with Material for MkDocs and adds support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks . It's built on top of the Highlight extension and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.inlinehilite See the section on inline code blocks for usage information. Keys \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for inserting keyboard keys , e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del , and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.keys SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code blocks inside other blocks , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Snippets \u00b6 The Snippets extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows to insert content from other files or other, regular content, and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.snippets Usage \u00b6 This section discusses how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments \u2013 the default highlighter \u2013 so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Specifying the language \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add code highlighting to those blocks, add the language short name directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the short name for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding annotations \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only Annotations offer a comfortable and friendly way to attach explanations to arbitrary sections of code blocks by adding simple markers within block/inline comments that refer to items of a list following the code block, i.e. (1) , (2) , etc. Material for MkDocs detaches the list from the flow of the document, injects the content of each list item into a tooltip, and links each list marker to the corresponding tooltip. In order to opt-in to annotation support, a slightly different syntax is required \u2013 just add the respective language short code and the .annotate class, after the three backticks. Alternatively, if you want to enable annotations globally, add the following to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - content.code.annotate Note that annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block where a comment for the language can be placed, which for JavaScript is // (1) and /* (2) */ , for Yaml # (3) , etc. Example : ``` js document$.subscribe(function() { // (1) var tables = document.querySelectorAll(/* (2) */ \"article table\") tables.forEach(function(table) { new Tablesort(table) }) }) ``` 1. ... 2. ... Result : document $ . subscribe ( function () { // (1) var tables = document . querySelectorAll ( /* (2) */ \"article table\" ) tables . forEach ( function ( table ) { new Tablesort ( table ) // (3) }) }) Annotations can contain arbitrary content which is shown when the marker is focussed, including any kind of formatting, links, admonitions, details, and even diagrams: graph LR A[I'm] --> B{a} --> C[diagram]; Tip: You can use Tab to navigate annotations. Annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block were a comment for the underlying language can be placed. Python # (1) JavaScript // (2) /* (2) */ Lua -- (3) We're working on a solution for languages without comments, which will be available shortly. Of course, this can be combined with line numbers , highlighting and all other code block related features. Annotations require syntax highlighting with Pygments \u2013 they're currently not compatible with other JavaScript-based syntax highlighters. Support may be added later on. Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the short name, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows splitting large code blocks for readability. Example : ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language short name. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums . Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Line ranges can also be used for conveniently specifying multiple lines. Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2-5\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code blocks \u00b6 When InlineHilite is enabled, inline code blocks can be highlighted by prefixing them with a shebang-like sequence, i.e. #! , directly followed by the language short name . Example : The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Result : The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Adding keyboard keys \u00b6 When Keys is enabled, keyboard keys can be rendered with a simple syntax. Consult the Python Markdown Extensions documentation to learn about all available key codes. Example : ++ctrl+alt+del++ Result : Ctrl + Alt + Del Embedding external files \u00b6 Also known as transcludes or file transclusion in MultiMarkdown . When Snippets is enabled, content from other files can be embedded, which is especially useful to reference and embed the contents of source files directly into your project documentation. Example : ``` --8<--\u200b \".browserslistrc\" ``` Result : last 4 years Note that Snippets is not limited to code blocks, but can be used anywhere from a document to move repeating content to separate files, which is also explained in the official documentation .

Material for MkDocs integrates with Mermaid.js , a very popular and flexible solution for drawing diagrams. Configuration \u00b6 SuperFences \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only The SuperFences extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for adding custom fences , which can be used to render Mermaid.js diagrams with zero effort: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences : custom_fences : - name : mermaid class : mermaid format : !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format No further configuration is necessary. Material for MkDocs will automatically load and initialize the Mermaid.js runtime when a page includes a fenced mermaid block . Furthermore: Works with instant loading without any additional effort Diagrams automatically use fonts and colors defined in mkdocs.yml 1 Fonts and colors can be customized with additional stylesheets Support for both, light and dark color schemes While it's also possible to integrate Mermaid.js using existing third-party plugins 2 , the new native integration is recommended as it ensures interoperability with all Material for MkDocs features. Usage \u00b6 Mermaid diagrams are written as code blocks with the help of the SuperFences extension. They must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. Using flowcharts \u00b6 Flowcharts are diagrams that represent workflows or processes. The steps are rendered as nodes of various kinds and are connected by edges, describing the necessary order of steps. Example : ``` mermaid graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; ``` Result : graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; Using sequence diagrams \u00b6 Sequence diagrams describe a specific scenario as sequential interactions between multiple objects or actors, including the messages that are exchanged between those actors. Example : ``` mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts! John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! ``` Result : sequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts! John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! Using state diagrams \u00b6 State diagrams are a great tool to describe the behavior of a system, decomposing it into a finite number of states, and transitions between those states. Example : ``` mermaid stateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Active state Active { [*] --> NumLockOff NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed -- [*] --> CapsLockOff CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed -- [*] --> ScrollLockOff ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed } ``` Result : stateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Active state Active { [*] --> NumLockOff NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed -- [*] --> CapsLockOff CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed -- [*] --> ScrollLockOff ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed } Using class diagrams \u00b6 Class diagrams are central to object oriented programing, describing the structure of a system by modelling entities as classes and relationships between them. Example : ``` mermaid classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } ``` Result : classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } Using entity-relationship diagrams \u00b6 An entity-relationship diagram is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that exist between entities. It describes inter-related things in a specific domain of knowledge. Example : ``` mermaid erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses ``` Result : erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses While all Mermaid.js features should work out-of-the-box, Material for MkDocs will currently adjust the fonts and colors for flow charts, sequence diagrams, class diagams, state diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. \u21a9 If you don't want to use the native integration, mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin might be a good alternative.

While arbitrary metadata can always be added via customization , some common meta tags can be configured. Configuration \u00b6 Metadata \u00b6 The Metadata extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, adds the ability to add front matter to a document and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta Front matter is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the YAML context. Usage \u00b6 Setting the page title \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page title can be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet --- # Document title ... This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Note that the site title is appended using a dash as a separator, which is the default behavior. Setting the page description \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page description can also be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. --- # Document title ... This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Adding a web app manifest \u00b6 A web app manifest is a simple JSON file that specifies how your web application should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop, which can be set via mkdocs.yml : extra : manifest : manifest.webmanifest Customization \u00b6 Displaying the metadata \u00b6 Sometimes it's useful to be able to display the medatada in the page body, e.g. print the name of the page author at the bottom of the page. To achieve that, you can extend the theme by adding the following contents to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block content %} {{ super() }} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.author %} < p >< small > Author: {{ page.meta.author }} </ small ></ p > {% endif %} {% endblock %} Custom meta tags \u00b6 on all pages \u00b6 In order to add custom meta tags to your document, you can extend the theme and simply override the extrahead block , e.g. to add indexing policies for search engines: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"noindex, nofollow\" /> {% endblock %} on a single page \u00b6 If you want to set a meta tag on a single page, or want to set different values for different pages, you can use the page.meta object inside your template override, e.g.: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.robots %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"{{ page.meta.robots }}\" /> {% else %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"index, follow\" /> {% endif %} {% endblock %} You can now use robots exactly like title and description to set values.

Customization \u00b6 Custom colors \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs implements colors using CSS variables (custom properties). If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand-specific colors), you can add an additional stylesheet and tweak the values of the CSS variables.

Custom color schemes \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Besides overriding specific colors, you can create your own, named color scheme by wrapping the definitions in the [ data-md-color-scheme = \"...\" ] attribute selector , which you can then set via mkdocs.yml as described in the color schemes section: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"youtube\" ] { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } Additionally, the slate color scheme defines all of it's colors via hsla color functions and deduces its colors from the --md-hue CSS variable.

Just add: : root { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } See the file containing the color definitions for a list of all CSS variables.","title":"Custom colors"},{"location":"setup/changing-the-colors/#custom-color-schemes","text":"Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Besides overriding specific colors, you can create your own, named color scheme by wrapping the definitions in the [ data-md-color-scheme = \"...\" ] attribute selector , which you can then set via mkdocs.yml as described in the color schemes section: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"youtube\" ] { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } Additionally, the slate color scheme defines all of it's colors via hsla color functions and deduces its colors from the --md-hue CSS variable.

Just add the following two feature flags to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tabs - navigation.tabs.sticky With sticky tabs Without sticky tabs Navigation sections \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When sections are enabled, top-level sections are rendered as groups in the sidebar for viewports above 1220px , but remain as-is on mobile. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.sections With sections Without sections Both feature flags, tabs and sections , can be combined with each other. If both feature flags are enabled, sections are rendered for level 2 navigation items. Navigation expansion \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When expansion is enabled, the left sidebar will expand all collapsible subsections by default, so the user doesn't have to open subsections manually. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.expand With expansion Without expansion Section index pages \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental When section index pages are enabled, documents can be directly attached to sections, which is particularly useful for providing overview pages. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.indexes With section index pages Without section index pages In order to link a page to a section, create a new document with the name index.md in the respective folder, and add it to the beginning of your navigation section: nav : - Section : - section/index.md - Page 1 : section/page-1.md ... - Page n : section/page-n.md This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections , except for table of contents navigation integration . Back-to-top button \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag A back-to-top button can be shown when the user, after scrolling down, starts to scroll up again. It's rendered centered and just below the header. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.top Table of contents \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Table of contents extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, provides some options that are supported by Material for MkDocs to customize its appearance: permalink Default: false \u2013 This option adds an anchor link containing the paragraph symbol \u00b6 or another custom symbol at the end of each headline, exactly like on the page you're currently viewing, which Material for MkDocs will make appear on hover: \u00b6 markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : true \u2693\ufe0e markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : \u2693\ufe0e slugify Default: headerid.slugify \u2013 This option allows for customization of the slug function. For some languages, the default may not produce good and readable identifiers \u2013 consider using another slug function like for example those from Python Markdown Extensions : Unicode markdown_extensions : - toc : slugify : !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify Unicode, case-sensitive markdown_extensions : - toc : slugify : !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify_cased toc_depth Default: 6 \u2013 Define the range of levels to be included in the table of contents. This may be useful for project documentation with deeply structured headings to decrease the length of the table of contents, or to remove the table of contents altogether: Hide levels 4-6 markdown_extensions : - toc : toc_depth : 3 Hide table of contents markdown_extensions : - toc : toc_depth : 0 Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but might yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. Navigation integration \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When integration is enabled, the table of contents is rendered as part of the navigation for viewports above 1220px , but remains as-is on mobile. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - toc.integrate Integrate table of contents Separate table of contents The content section will now always stretch to the right side, resulting in more space for your content. This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections . Usage \u00b6 Hiding the sidebars \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata Sometimes it's desirable to hide the navigation and/or table of contents sidebar, especially when there's a single navigation item. This can be done for any page using the Metadata extension: --- hide: - navigation - toc --- # Document title ... Hide navigation Hide table of contents Hide both Customization \u00b6 Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs includes several keyboard shortcuts that make it possible to navigate your project documentation via keyboard. There're two modes: search This mode is active when the search is focused . It provides several key bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard: Down , Up : select next / previous result Esc , Tab : close search dialog Enter : follow selected result global This mode is active when search is not focussed and when there's no other focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners. Content area width \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional stylesheet and a few lines of CSS: Increase width . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; } Stretch to fit . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } Prior to version 6.2, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page. This made it impossible to include a top-level page (or external link) as a tab item, as was reported in #1884 and #2072 . From version 6.2 on, navigation tabs include all top-level pages and sections. \u21a9","title":"Setting up navigation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-navigation/#10-navigation","text":"A clear and concise navigation structure is an important aspect of good project documentation.

Offline search \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Plugin If you distribute your documentation as *.html files, the built-in search will not work out-of-the-box due to the restrictions modern browsers impose for security reasons. This can be mitigated with the localsearch plugin in combination with @squidfunk 's iframe-worker polyfill. For setup instructions, refer to the official documentation . Tip When distributing documentation as HTML files to be opened from the file system, you will also want to set use_directory_urls: false in mkdocs.yml to make page links function correctly. Usage \u00b6 Search boosting \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata \u00b7 Insiders only In order to give specific pages a higher relevance in search, lunr supports page-specific boosts, which can be defined for each page by leveraging the Metadata extension: --- search: boost: 100 --- # Document title ... Search exclusion \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only Excluding pages \u00b6 Sometimes, it's necessary to exclude a page from the search index, which can be achieved by adding the following front matter using the Metadata extension: --- search: exclude: true --- # Document title ... Excluding sections \u00b6 With the help of the Attribute List extension, it's possible to exclude a specific section of a page from search by adding the { data-search-exclude } pragma after the Markdown heading: docs/page.md # Document title ## Section 1 The content of this section is included ## Section 2 { data-search-exclude } The content of this section is excluded search_index.json { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#section-1\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this section is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Section 1\" } ] } Excluding blocks \u00b6 If even more fine-grained control is needed, content blocks can be excluded from search sections with a { data-search-exclude } pragma, so they will not be included in the search index: docs/page.md # Document title The content of this block is included The content of this block is excluded { data-search-exclude } search_index.json { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this block is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" } ] } Customization \u00b6 The search implementation of Material for MkDocs is probably its most sophisticated feature, as it tries to balance a great typeahead experience , good performance , accessibility , and a result list that is easy to scan . This is where Material for MkDocs deviates from other themes. The following section explains how search can be customized to tailor it to your needs. Query transformation \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy When a user enters a query into the search box, the query is pre-processed before it is submitted to the search index. Material for MkDocs will apply the following transformations, which can be customized by extending the theme : export function defaultTransform ( query : string ) : string { return query . split ( /\"([^\"]+)\"/g ) /* (1) */ . map (( terms , index ) => index & 1 ? terms . replace ( /^\\b|^(?![^\\x00-\\x7F]|$)|\\s+/g , \" +\" ) : terms ) . join ( \"\" ) . replace ( /\"|(?:^|\\s+)[*+\\-:^~]+(?=\\s+|$)/g , \"\" ) /* (2) */ . trim () /* (3) */ } Search for terms in quotation marks and prepend a + modifier to denote that the resulting document must contain all terms, converting the query to an AND query (as opposed to the default OR behavior). While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index. Custom search \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: challenging Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker . If you want to switch the web worker with your own implementation, e.g. to submit search to an external service, you can add a custom JavaScript file to the docs directory and override the config block : {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { worker : \"<url>\" } </ script > {% endblock %} Communication with the search worker is implemented using a designated message format using discriminated unions , i.e. through the type property of the message. See the following interface definitions to learn about the message formats: SearchMessage SearchIndex and SearchResult The sequence and direction of messages is rather intuitive: SearchSetupMessage SearchReadyMessage SearchQueryMessage SearchResultMessage","title":"Setting up site search"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#setting-up-site-search","text":"Material for MkDocs provides an excellent, client-side search implementation, omitting the need for the integration of third-party services, which might be tricky to integrate to be compliant with data privacy regulations.

While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index.","title":"Query transformation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#custom-search","text":"Source \u00b7 Difficulty: challenging Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker .

When deploying a new version, older versions of your documentation remain untouched. Configuration \u00b6 Versioning \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Utility mike makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of your project documentation. It integrates natively with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : extra : version : provider : mike This will render a version selector in the header next to the title of your project: A demo is worth a thousand words \u2014 check it out at squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material-example-versioning Why use mike? mike is built around the idea that once you've generated your docs for a particular version, you should never need to touch that version again. This means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in your gh-pages branch. While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a <major>.<minor> directory, with optional aliases (e.g. latest or dev ) to particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever version of the documentation you want to direct people to. Note that you don't need to run mike install-extras as noted in the official documentation , as mike is now natively integrated with Material for MkDocs. Version warning \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Insiders only If you're using versioning, you might want to display a warning when the user visits any other version than the latest version. Using theme extension , you can define the outdated block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block outdated %} You're not viewing the latest version. < a href = \"{{ '../' ~ base_url }}\" > <!-- (1) --> < strong > Click here to go to latest. </ strong > </ a > {% endblock %} Given this value for the href attribute, the link will always redirect to the root of your site, which will then redirect to the latest version. This ensures that older versions of your site do not depend on a specific alias, e.g. latest , to allow for changing the alias later on without breaking earlier versions. This will render a version warning above the header: By default, the default version is identified by the latest alias. If you wish to set another alias as the latest version, e.g. stable , add the following to mkdocs.yml : extra : version : default : stable Make sure that this matches the default version .

Setting a default version \u00b6 When starting with mike , a good idea is to set an alias as a default version, e.g. latest , and when publishing a new version, always update the alias to point to the latest version: mike set-default --push latest When publishing a new version, mike will create a redirect in the root of your project documentation to the version associated with the alias: docs.example.com docs.example.com/0.1","title":"Setting up versioning"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#setting-up-versioning","text":"Material for MkDocs makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of your project documentation by integrating with external utilities that add those capabilities to MkDocs, i.e. mike .

This means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in your gh-pages branch. While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a <major>.<minor> directory, with optional aliases (e.g. latest or dev ) to particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever version of the documentation you want to direct people to. Note that you don't need to run mike install-extras as noted in the official documentation , as mike is now natively integrated with Material for MkDocs.","title":"Versioning"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#version-warning","text":"Source \u00b7 Insiders only If you're using versioning, you might want to display a warning when the user visits any other version than the latest version. Using theme extension , you can define the outdated block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block outdated %} You're not viewing the latest version. < a href = \"{{ '../' ~ base_url }}\" > <!-- (1) --> < strong > Click here to go to latest. </ strong > </ a > {% endblock %} Given this value for the href attribute, the link will always redirect to the root of your site, which will then redirect to the latest version. This ensures that older versions of your site do not depend on a specific alias, e.g. latest , to allow for changing the alias later on without breaking earlier versions. This will render a version warning above the header: By default, the default version is identified by the latest alias. If you wish to set another alias as the latest version, e.g. stable , add the following to mkdocs.yml : extra : version : default : stable Make sure that this matches the default version
